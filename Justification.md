We have made the decision to make our code free to use with little restriction because of how replicable the code is.
In real life, this code has little marketable value since it is incredibly simple and easy to mimic if not copied.
So it wouldn’t matter whether or not this code was restrictive in its use because any determent would be of minimal consequence to the user or ourselves.
